# Protein_location

Using Machine Learning to predict the location of a protein in a cell.

## Building my own RNN and LSTM network using Numpy

First, to understand the RNN and LSTM network I have build them from the ground using only Numpy.
The files can be found in the additional folder.

## Subcellular protein location

After making the RNN and LSTM myself. I used PyTorch to make the protein language model.
Then, I used that language model to classify subcellular location based on the amino acid sequence.

More info coming soon.
